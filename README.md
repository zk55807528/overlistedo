# Me
A young Debian user and programmer.

### Languages I can write in:
- Java - **Bullshit**
- Kotlin - Very interesting combination of OOP and FP
- JavaScript - Just easy to write in
- TypeScript - Pretty good for web development
- Vala - Very rare case of a good compiled OOP language
- C - Super simple and fast
- C++ - **Bullshit but faster**
- Shell - I only like bash and zsh
- Haskell - I'm not a pro at it but it's pretty interesting
- Rust - Fast and amazing
